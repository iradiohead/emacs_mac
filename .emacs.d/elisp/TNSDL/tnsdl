2.1 Set up GNU Emacs
====================

GNU Emacs is part of DMXSee. However, only an extremely old, outdated
version, what is not supported by tnsdl-mode from version 2.0.0
onwards.  Thus you have to install another, newer Emacs for yourself.
Here follows how.

For general info see `xxx'.

For MS Windows installers, see `xxx'.

For MS Windows I recommend using the official precompiled binaries
from `xxx'.  Their "installation" means unzipping the downloaded file
and manually setting some things in MS Windows:

  1. Set `HOME' environment variable to point e.g. `C:\USERS\'.  Your
     `.emacs' file will be here. Remember its location!  *Note
     Windows HOME: (emacs)Windows HOME.

  2. Associate `.sdl', `.sdt', `.spd', `.sst' etc. files to Emacs.

Also *Note Help installing Emacs: (efaq)Help installing Emacs, and
*Note Using an already running Emacs process: (efaq)Using an already
running Emacs process.

2.2.2 Emacs Terminology
-----------------------

These are not "official" definitions, just short scratches for
beginners to help understanding further Emacs documentation.

"point"
     The cursor and/or its location (in terms of character position).
     *Note Point: (emacs)Point.

"kill"
     Item is copied and deleted. Well known name for this
     functionality: "cut".

"yank"
     Previously "killed" or "copied" item is pasted.

"frame"
     It is a "window" from the windowing system's (e.g. MS Windows)
     point of view.

"buffer"
     It is a piece of text. Usually a whole file's content.

"window"
     A part of a "frame". One frame can consist of one or more
     windows.  Windows can be splitted into more (smaller) windows.

"visit a file"
     Opening it in Emacs.

"fontification"
     Syntax highlighting.

"minibuffer"
     The (generally) one-line area at the bottom of a frame, where
     you can e.g. type commands in. Note: Emacs communicates with you
     mainly via the minibuffer!  *Note Minibuffer: (emacs)Minibuffer.

"command"
     An Emacs function designed to be callable by end users. *Note
     Commands: (emacs)Commands.

   For many more terms explained more exactly *Note Glossary:
(emacs)Glossary.  For learning more about the screen *Note Screen:
(emacs)Screen.

2.2.3 Getting Help
------------------

Most of the "interactive" help within Emacs is available in Info.  To
learn about its usage *Note Top: (info)Top.

   Type <C-h ?> anytime for a list of available help possibilities.
Some of them:
<C-h b>
     List all key sequences usable at the moment (in the current
     window!).

<C-h i>
     Opens the Info reader with enourmos amount of available local,
     hypertexted documentation.

<C-h k>
     Type a key sequence or click a mouse button (e.g. on a menu):
     its help is shown.

<C-h l>
     Helps finding out what triggered the last events: show your last
     100 keystroke.

2.2.4 Useful Commands
---------------------

Several basic Emacs key combinations and commands are mentioned above
(*Note Emacs Key Notation::, and *Note Getting Help::).

   Here I list some more, what are especially useful for TNSDL
development. (tnsdl-mode's own commands are not listed here.  For
them *Note Everyday Usage::.)

   If you read this in Emacs' Info reader (recommended), then move
the cursor (point) onto the function names below one by one, and
press <C-h f> <RET> on them: <C-h f> calls the Emacs function
(command) `describe-function' with default value derived from text
found around point.  (Note: Emacs communicates with you mainly via
the minibuffer. Check it!)  Then <RET> tells that the default's
descripton is looked for. The "description" contains the function's
name, the actual key combination(s) bound to it, a short description
about its usage, etc. The best is to try them immediately in a trial
(TNSDL) buffer...

   `indent-for-tab-command'

   `isearch-forward' - `isearch-backward'
   `isearch-forward-regexp' - `isearch-backward-regexp'

   `dabbrev-expand'

   `query-replace' - `query-replace-regexp'
   `replace-string' - `replace-regexp'

   `comment-dwim'

   `just-one-space' - `delete-horizontal-space'
   `delete-blank-lines'
   `kill-line' - `kill-whole-line' - `kill-sexp' -> *Note Erasing:
(emacs)Erasing.

   `find-tag'

   `forward-sexp' - `backward-sexp'

   `mark-sexp'

   `split-window-vertically' - `split-window-horizontally'
   `other-window'

   `delete-other-windows'

   `kill-buffer'

   `make-frame-command'

   `count-lines-region' -> *Note Position Info: (emacs)Position Info.

   `goto-line' -> *Note Moving Point: (emacs)Moving Point.

   `upcase-word' - `downcase-word'

   `undo'

   `hs-minor-mode'

   `color-theme-select' (requires ColorThemes (http://www.))

For others *Note Help: (emacs)Help. *Note Basic: (emacs)Basic.

Do not forget to check refcard.ps in the `emacs/etc' directory.

2.3 Set up tnsdl-mode
=====================

Everything what is needed for tnsdl-mode is downloadable from
`http://xxx'.

   In this section we describe all the details about how to use these
files: how to "install" the functionality and the documentation.
Source files also described with full details.

* Menu:

* Functionality::
* Documentation::
* Sources::


File: tnsdl,  Node: Functionality,  Next: Documentation,  Up: Set up tnsdl-mode

2.3.1 Functionality
-------------------

tnsdl-mode's functionality is implemented in one single file:
`tnsdl.el'. Since Emacs can interpret source files, you should have
either this source file, or its byte compiled version `tnsdl.elc' for
using tnsdl-mode.

   To make Emacs find this file when needed, copy it into a directory
where Emacs looks for such files: type `C-h v load-path <RET>'. This
brings up a help window showing the value (and meaning) of the
variable `load-path'. Any directory in the list will suffice;
`emacs/site-lisp' is dedicated to such purposes, so you can choose it
safely.

   After copying `tnsdl.el(c)' into such a directory, Emacs can find
it. Now you have to order Emacs to load it when it starts. For this,
locate your `.emacs' file (*note Set up GNU Emacs::) and add this
line to its end: `(load "tnsdl")'. Go to the end of the expression
you've just typed (so place the cursor (point) immediately after the
closing paren `)') and type `C-x C-e'. From now on all tnsdl-mode
functionalities should be available. Try it by opening (visiting) a
tnsdl file.

   *Note Lisp Libraries: (emacs)Lisp Libraries.


File: tnsdl,  Node: Documentation,  Next: Sources,  Prev: Functionality,  Up: Set up tnsdl-mode

2.3.2 Documentation
-------------------

tnsdl-mode's documentation comes in the following forms:

Info
     for online reading (inside Emacs or in another info reader),

PDF
     for printing and

HTML
     for browsing in a web browser.

   You know how to handle HTML and PDF files.

   The Info file `tnsdl' can be "installed" for Emacs, so you will
reach it via the standard Emacs help system. Here is a step-by-step
instruction how to install.

  1. Locate documentation coming with Emacs. You should find it under
     `your Emacs documentation directory/info'. If you don't know
     where is it, try searching e.g. for file `elisp-8'.

  2. Copy the info file `tnsdl' into this directory.

  3. Edit the file `dir' in this directory: add a line like

     * TNSDL: (tnsdl).       Emacs mode for developing TNSDL PRBs.

      after e.g. the line

     * Info: (info).         How to use the documentation browsing system.

      Next time you type `C-h i', the hypertexted root of
     tnsdl-mode's documentation will be linked in: type `RET' on it
     and start browsing!


File: tnsdl,  Node: Sources,  Prev: Documentation,  Up: Set up tnsdl-mode

2.3.3 Sources
-------------

Here is a full list of tnsdl-mode's source files along with their
usage.  If you want to contribute to tnsdl-mode development, use
(enhance) these files.  Otherwise you can safely skip this subsection.

`tnsdl.el'
     Contains the Emacs Lisp implementation of all the functionality
     of tnsdl-mode.  Byte compiled `tnsdl.elc' file can be generated
     from it.

`tnsdl.texinfo'
     Source of all the documentation: both Info file `tnsdl',
     `tnsdl.pdf' and HTML documentation files are generated from it.

`test_tnsdlmode.sdl'
     A (partly pathological) TNSDL file to test syntax highlighting,
     indenatation, move commands, etc.

`test_tnsdlmode.el'
     "Unit tests" for tnsdl-mode development.

3 Everyday Usage
****************

The purpose of tnsdl-mode is to help everyday sw development work.

   Most of tnsdl-mode is nothing more than supporting and customizing
of standard Emacs functionalities.

   Source code typing, modification, reviewing and navigation are
helped as well as compilation and other related activities. Details
follows in this chapter.

* Menu:

* Syntax Highlighting:: Various ways of it are introduced.
* Indentation::         Automatic and commanded; reindentation and
                          alignement.
* Navigation::          Jumping to different locations.
* Hide and Show::       Folding.
* Compilation::         Compile your .pac from tnsdl-mode!


File: tnsdl,  Node: Syntax Highlighting,  Next: Indentation,  Up: Everyday Usage

3.1 Syntax Highlighting
=======================

This is standard Emacs functionality, but I added a menu for it:
Tnsdl > Font-lock.

   Fontification can be totally switched off or switched on.

   You can choose from a lot of ready-to-use color schemes or you can
define your own fonts to use. I recommend the former one using
ColorThemes: http:\\xxx.

   When fontificaton is switched on, several levels can be applied:

Level-0
     highlights only the most basic elements: strings, comments,
     compiler directives and STATEs, PROCEDUREs and TYPEs.

Level-1
     adds fontification for all keywords

Level-2
     additionally highlights type names (like `byte', `bool', etc. or
     ending with `_t'), constant names (ending with `_c' or `_ec'),
     variable and parameter names (starting with `g_', `l_' or `p_'),
     etc.

   For more, general info *Note Levels of Font Lock: (elisp)Levels of
Font Lock.


File: tnsdl,  Node: Indentation,  Next: Navigation,  Prev: Syntax Highlighting,  Up: Everyday Usage

3.2 Indentation
===============

tnsdl-mode indents lines automatically when `RET' is typed: both the
just-closed and the just-started lines are indented.

   Typing `TAB' once tries to indent intelligently: indentation
happens (instead of inserting spaces or tabs) if point wasn't in a
place where inserting whitespace seems to be reasonable.

   Second and following `TAB' typings do xxx. This in practice can be
used for alignement quite comfortably.

   Regions etc. can be reindented using the Tnsdl menu.

   Each line's indentation is calculated from patterns found in the
actual and preceding lines. When the actual line is empty (=just
started), calculation can be wrong easily. In such cases type the
line and hope `RET' at the end of the line will reindent well.

   When automatic identation does a wrong job, indent the line
manually, and hope following lines' automatic indentation will be
calculated in a good way from it.


File: tnsdl,  Node: Navigation,  Next: Hide and Show,  Prev: Indentation,  Up: Everyday Usage

3.3 Navigation
==============

A lot of standard (and sometimes most convenient!) possibilities are
not mentioned below. Check the `Edit' menu (especially its `Search'
and `Go To' submenus) for them.  I use `Incremental Search' most of
the time.

   Also note that *Note Top: (speedbar)Top. is supported. Try it:
`M-x speedbar <RET>'.

* Menu:

* Nearby::   How to skip by symbol or by statement...
* Far::      How to skip decision branches, procedures, etc.
* Away::     Go away into (possibly) other files containing a
               specific definition...


File: tnsdl,  Node: Nearby,  Next: Far,  Up: Navigation

3.3.1 Nearby
------------

Use standard Emacs commands: `forward-word'/`backward-word',
`forward-sentence'/`backward-sentence' (this is quite handy!), etc.


File: tnsdl,  Node: Far,  Next: Away,  Prev: Nearby,  Up: Navigation

3.3.2 Far
---------

Skipping bigger entities (e.g. branches of DECISIONs or any code
enclosed by <keyword>-END<keyword> pairs) is supported by the
`forward-sexp'/`backward-sexp' functions.

   When you want to "skip out" from such a block, then
`tnsdl-goto-block-start'/`tnsdl-goto-block-end' can be used. These are
in the Tnsdl menu, but no keys are bound to them by default.

   Skipping to the start/end of the actual PROCEDURE has its own menu
and keys. `beginning-of-defun'/`end-of-defun' do these.

   Many other (probably interactively less useful) tnsdl-specific move
commands are defined: check (via `C-h a') the commands starting with
`tnsdl-goto-'.

   Note: It is a good practice to use `point-to-register' to store
any loaction where to you want to go back later.


File: tnsdl,  Node: Away,  Prev: Far,  Up: Navigation

3.3.3 Away
----------

Skipping to a specific PROCEDURE or TYPE is easiest using TAG files.
Generate/refresh the TAG file using the menu `Etag'.  Sometimes you
have to load the freshly generated file(s) using `visit-tags-table'.
Then use `find-tag'.  Usually it defaults to the right name, but you
can type any name you want.


File: tnsdl,  Node: Hide and Show,  Next: Compilation,  Prev: Navigation,  Up: Everyday Usage

3.4 Hide and Show
=================

Some bigger entities (e.g. branches of DECISIONs or complete
PROCEDUREs or their long FPAR or DCL parts or long comments, etc.)
can be hidden temporarily. This functionality is usually referred
elsewhere as "folding".  Use `hs-minor-mode' for it. (It is not
activated by tnsdl-mode by default, you have to switch this minor
mode on by yourself: type `M-x hs-minor-mode <RET>'. Then its menu
appears...)


File: tnsdl,  Node: Compilation,  Prev: Hide and Show,  Up: Everyday Usage

3.5 Compilation
===============

Currently I suggest compilation is the following way.

  1. Create your own MS Windows batch file what compiles from command
     line.  E.g. a file `buildmyprb.cmd' could look like this:
     `call meenv 5.1-0
     build -dstdout -mk2cd -rm2cd -test -timestamp my__scmx.pac.'
     Note: these two lines are enough for compilation.

  2. Copy this `buildmyprb.cmd' into the directory where your
     `my__scmx.pac' resides.

  3. Open a file from this directory in Emacs. E.g. it is a good
     practice to visit the `my__scmx.pac' file and set the `.img''s
     id in it.

  4. `M-x compile RET buildmyprb.cmd RET'
     (Note: after the first time, you can use `M-x recompile RET'
     instead.)  After this, compilation starts (you may have to open
     an SPM connection before it).  Compilation messages appears in
     their own buffer.  tnsdl-mode adds knowledge to highlight error
     and warning messages differently and makes them links.

  5. Click on an error/warning message and the file at the
     problematic line will be opened.  If Emacs ask you to locate the
     directory where the problematic file resides, then usually the
     best is to open any TNSDL file from that directory and check-in
     TNSDL menu's Compilation > In search path before the compilation
     process.  After this, all source files in that directory fill be
     found automatically by Emacs.

4 Customization
***************

To customize tnsdl-mode use the menu `Tnsdl > Customize'.

   It is usually a good idea to bind your favourite commands to key
combinations, so you don't have to type `M-x my-fav-command <RET>'
always.  You can choose any key combination you like (even "self
inserting" keys like <TAB> or <RET> or simple symbols like <~> or
letters etc.  can be rebound), but `C-c <letter>' are reserved for
such purposes (=for users): no major or minor modes should use them.

   To bind e.g. `C-c b' to the command `tnsdl-goto-block-start', put
this line into your `.emacs' file (append to its end):
     (define-key tnsdl-mode-map "\C-cb" 'tnsdl-goto-block-start)

please inform the author, so I can add you modification to the
"official" version.

   If you comply with my coding conventions, then I can easily merge
your enhancements into the code. Here I list some of them.

5.0.1 Coding conventions
------------------------

   * Each function's, option's, ... name starts with `tnsdl-'.

   * Everything (functions, variables, ...) is documented in its
     documentation string.

   * Functions' (intentional) returned values should be mentioned
     explicitly in their docstring.

   * Whenever it is possible, add functionality via supporting
     official minor modes and features instead of reinventing the
     wheel. Examples: hs-minor-mode, imenu, `forward-sexp', etc.

Appendix A Supported Features
*****************************

Here is a (hopefully full) list of standard Emacs features what are
supported by tnsdl-mode. I.e. these can be used (in addition to the
special tnsdl-mode-features) "out of the box".

   Type `C-h f <RET>' on them to get more info.

   * which-func-mode

   * imenu (makes TAG files unnecessary locally)

   * hs-minor-mode ("folding")

   * font-lock-mode (syntax highlighting)

   * compilation-mode (to skip to the problematic source code line
     from the compilation log)

Appendix B News
***************

   * v2

     This is a complete rewrite from scratch. Made by Peter Tury.  It
     works only with Emacs v22 or later.

     New features:

        * complete documentation

        * standard Emacs customizability (via `M-x customize-mode')

        * multi-level and more exact syntax highlighting

        * folding

        * tnsdl-specific code browsing (`forward-sexp', etc.)

        * enhanced(?) automatic indentation

        * TAG support

        * compilation support

     Removed features:

        * abbreviations (I found `dabbrev-expand' enough)

        * skeletons (I didn't use them)

        * unknown functionalities (probably there were some)

   * v1

     First(?) tnsdl-mode was created and maintained by Harri M‰enp‰‰
     until 1992.  Later Toni Arte and Tero Venetjoki maintained it
     for many years. Its variants can be used for older Emacses (from
     version 17(?)).

     It knew:
        * one-level syntax highlighting

        * automatic indentation

        * menu

        * imenu support

        * abbreviations

        * skeletons
